# Java Regular Expressions

### About This Workshop
Regular Expressions are an extremely handy tool to have at your disposal. They are also incredibly
intimidating looking if you donâ€™t know how or why someone is using them. Regular Expressions are
common in just about every programming language, and developers have leaned on their power for many
solutions. We use them for searching, replacing and validating that text meets certain formats.
