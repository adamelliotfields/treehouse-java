# Spring Security

### About This Workshop
In this workshop, we'll discuss how to get up and running with user authentication and authorization
using Spring Security. We'll be storing user data, including names and passwords, in a database. Our
Spring MVC app connects to the database using Hibernate. By the end of this course, you will have
added user authentication to a simple task management application, allowing users to login, create
new tasks, and mark & unmark them as complete.
