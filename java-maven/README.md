# Java Maven

### About This Workshop
Developing applications for distribution usually involves the use of a build tool. In the Java
world, this is likely either Gradle or Maven. In this workshop, we'll explore the basic use of Maven
as a tool to compile, test, and package your application. We'll cover the standard directory layout
of a Maven project, the Project Object Model (POM), and dependency management with Maven.
