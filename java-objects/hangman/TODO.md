### TODO

 - [x] As a guesser, I should be able to submit a guess, so that I can play the game.
 - [x] As a guesser, I should be presented with my current progress, so that I can make an educated guess.
 - [x] As a guesser, I should know how many remaining tries I have left, so I am encouraged to be cautious.
 - [x] As a guesser, I should be stopped from making a guess that has already been made, so that I do not waste turns.
 - [x] As a guesser, I should be able to know when the game is won or lost, so that I can acknowledge completion.
